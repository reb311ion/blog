The first stage of the malware is an ancient-looking word document carrying an executable file. It will ask the victim to double click the icon to enable a clear view and once clicked it will active the content of the OLE package which will result in the extraction of the executable file to the system's temp directory and execute it. The dropped exe is named `POM.exe`.

The file is a Native Microsoft Visual Basic executable. Commonly, VB6 files are used as droppers or downloaders for other campaign stages.

![image-20191214144641420](image-20191214144641420.png)

from behavioral analysis, the file will drop two files in  `%TEMP%\subfolder` :

- `filename.exe`
- `filename.vbs`

![image-20191214155116846](image-20191214155116846.png)

It will then run `filename.vbs` with `WScript.exe` and exit.

```powershell
"C:\Windows\System32\WScript.exe" "C:\Users\rebellion\AppData\Local\Temp\subfolder\filename.vbs" 
```

Analyzing  ``filename.vbs`` content I found that it writes itself to the `RunOnce`registry key with the key-value `Registry Key Name` to reach persistence on the victim's machine.

![image-20191214160328226](image-20191214160328226.png)

It then starts `filename.exe` then exit. The hardcoded strings within `filename.vbs` are created dynamically by `POM.exe` to get the current username. `filename.vbs` content:

```js
On Error Resume Next
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
myKey = "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\Registry Key Name"
WshShell.RegWrite myKey,"C:\Users\rebellion\AppData\Local\Temp\subfolder\filename.vbs","REG_SZ"
WshShell.Run "C:\Users\rebellion\AppData\Local\Temp\subfolder\filename.exe"
```

The file is a VB6 packed binary that will unpack the malicious code and write it to a newly created instance of itself. This technique is commonly described as Process hollowing

>  Process hollowing occurs when a malware unmaps (hollows out) the legitimate code from memory of the target process, and overwrites the memory space of the target process with a malicious executable. 

![processhollowing_](processhollowing_.gif)

The malware first creates a new process to host the malicious code in suspended mode this is done by calling `CreateProcessInternalW` and setting the Process Creation Flag to `CREATE_SUSPENDED` `(0x00000004)`. The primary thread of the new process is created in a suspended state and does not run until the `NtResumeThread` function is called. 

![image-20191214175536328](image-20191214175536328.png)

Next, the malware needs to swap out the contents of the legitimate file with its malicious payload. This is done by unmapping the memory of the target process by calling either `ZwUnmapViewOfSection` or `NtUnmapViewOfSection`. This two APIs release all memory pointed to by a section. 

![image-20191214175750942](image-20191214175750942.png)

Now that the memory is unmapped, the loader performs `VirtualAllocEx` to allocate new memory for the malware ( the problem here is VB6 uses a VM that will allocate and deallocate memory constantly so it's not efficient to trace which call(s) will contain the malicious code. Uses `ZwWriteVirtualMemory` malware can then write each of the malwareâ€™s sections to the target process space.

![image-20191214181011501](image-20191214181011501.png)

 The malware calls `SetThreadContext` to point the `Entrypoint` to a new code section that it has written. In the end, the malware resumes the suspended thread by calling `NtResumeThread` to take the process out of suspended state. 

![image-20191214175844063](image-20191214175844063.png)

So the key to unpack the malware is to breakpoint on `NtResumeThread` and dump the hollowed process from memory  using tools like `Scyllahide` and `OllyDumpEX`

![image-20191214192336110](image-20191214192336110.png)



### ==Stage 3 [Part 2]: Unpacked.exe Analysis==

The file will first check for `Cor_Enable_Profiing` environment variable is set to `1` or if one of the DLLs `mscorjit.dll` or `clrjit.dll` is mapped into current program's virtual address space, if any condition is true it will exit without doing any action as an anti-Debugging technique.

![image-20191217010110213](image-20191217010110213.png)

![image-20191217010256773](image-20191217010256773.png)

If not, it will go back to `LABEL_13` and continue the execution process

![image-20191217010928278](image-20191217010928278.png)

  it first decrypts the resource name "__" from an encrypted stack string and uses it to load an encrypted resource file using `FindResourceA` and `LoadResource` API functions  

![image-20191217020057372](image-20191217020057372.png)

the decrypted resource turned out to be another executable file (a .Net one), which then gets passed to `AllocateMemForDecryptedBuff` to allocate a memory buffer with the decrypted data. after this step `DecryptedBuff` is filled with zeros and deallocated.

![image-20191217015250067](image-20191217015250067.png)

What's special about `AllocateMemForDecryptedBuff` function is that it keeps the `MZ` header and  `DOS` stub without even touching them while modifying and mapping specific parts of the decrypted resource to keep it runnable from memory but corrupted when dumping it to a file which is smart enough as an anti-Dumping technique.

![image-20191217014832107](image-20191217014832107.png)   

After loading the needed libraries the malware will jump directly to `CoreExeMain` and start executing the .Net managed code from there.

![image-20191217023232510](image-20191217023232510.png)

![image-20191217023119955](image-20191217023119955.png)

![image-20191214194134953](image-20191214194134953.png)

So all we need to dump a valid copy from the decrypted resource is to dump it just after calling the `DecryptLoadedResource` function, right? 

![d](d.gif)

 and just use any hex editor to remove everything before the `MZ` header, I used `HxD`. 

### ==Stage 3 [Part 3]:  Dumped.exe Analysis==

The file we dumped was obfuscated to harden the analysis but.

![image-20191217031156942](image-20191217031156942.png)

Deobfuscating the first layer of obfuscation turned out there is a function called `smethod_0` responsible for string decryption and all strings are passed to it first:

![image-20191217032917611](image-20191217032917611.png)

![image-20191217033116125](image-20191217033116125.png)

Again`De4dot` can emulate the string decryption for us, we just need the function token, we can get it from `Dnspy` by  navigating functions:

![image-20191217033511470](image-20191217033511470.png) 

![image-20191217033625811](image-20191217033625811.png)

And now we can start our code Analysis

![image-20191217033943597](image-20191217033943597.png)

Analyzing the program, I found that once executed, it waits for `15` seconds then goes through the currently running processes to kill any duplicate processes found. the following two if statements are responsible for 

- Identify the current OS version [7, 8, 9] and disable the Limited User Account `LUA` from the registry to bypass  User Account Controls `UAC`  
- send `uninstall` and `update`  commands to the C&C server. If the response to the `uninstall`  command from the server contains an `uninstall` string, it cleans up the information it has written on the victimâ€™s machine and exits.

However they were disabled using a previously set variables:

- ```bool_SetToFalse = False```
- ```Str_SetToSmtp = "smtp"```

Boolean variables are used heavily inside the code to control the execution flow with predefined values. 

![image-20191219230913101](image-20191219230913101.png)

Main functions functionalities could be identified by the `type` value.

![image-20191219223621445](image-20191219223621445.png) 

![image-20191219223813110](image-20191219223813110.png)

The reason why I renamed the function taking the formatted data to `DeprecatedSendToC2` is that it won't send anything! the attacker replaced the `C2` domain with `%PostURL%` which will always result in an exception and enter the empty catch at the bottom of the function then just return. Mostly the malware used this function before to encrypt and send data over HTTP but now it's useless. 

![image-20191219224733049](image-20191219224733049.png)   

However, the author uses a free `Zoho` email to log and receive the data over SMTP (Port 587) instead.

![image-20191219225402759](image-20191219225402759.png)

![image-20191219225205502](image-20191219225205502.png)

Also not all functions used by `DeprecatedSendToC2` were used by `SendToEmail` function so let's focus on the 4 main functions that uses `SendToEmail` 

![image-20191219225937416](image-20191219225937416.png)



##### `DumpPasswords`

Function collects credentials from a variety of software on the victimâ€™s machine. It can collect user credentials from the system registry, local profile files, SQLite database files, and so on. Once it has captured the credentials of one the software packages if encrypted it tries to decrypt it and send it over SMTP.

Software targeted by the malware are identifiable from a function used by every password harvesting sub-function

![image-20191220001333551](image-20191220001333551.png)

![image-20191220001513421](image-20191220001513421.png)

So based on my analysis, this malware can obtain the credentials from the following software.

- Browsers
  - Google Chrome
  - Mozilla  Firefox
  - Opera
  - Yandex
  - Microsoft IE
  - Apple  Safari
  - SeaMonkey
  - ComodoDragon
  - FlockBrowser
  - CoolNovo
  - SRWareIron
  - UC  browser
  - Torch Browser

- Email clients
  - Microsoft Office Outlook
  - Mozilla Thunderbird
  - Foxmail
  - Opera Mail
  - PocoMail
  - Eudora
  - TheBat

- FTP clients
  - FileZilla
  - WS_FTP
  - WinSCP
  - CoreFTP
  - FlashFXP
  - SmartFTP
  - FTPCommander

- Dynamic DNS
  - DynDNS

- Video chatting
  - Paltalk
  - Pidgin

- Download management
  - Internet Download Manager
  - JDownloader

##### `KeyLog`

Before the Main function is called, three hook objects are defined in the construction function of the main class. These are used for hooking the Keyboard, Mouse, and Clipboard. It then sets hook functions for all of them so that when the victim inputs something by keyboard, or when the clipboard data is changed (Ctrl+C), the hook functions will be called first. 

![image-20191220111621906](image-20191220111621906.png)

![image-20191220162622802](image-20191220162622802.png)

The keylog file is saved to `%temp%/log.tmp` and it gets concatenated with other information taken from the machine before sending, collected information includes:

- Username
- PC Name
- OS Ful Name
- OS Platform
- OS Version
- CPU
- RAM
- ViedoCard Name
- ViedoCard Memory
- Public IP address

![image-20191220114911362](image-20191220114911362.png)

then the formatted data is sent and the log file is deleted. the system info functions including `GetVictimExternalIp` Function are used across the 4 malware modules.

![image-20191220003145057](image-20191220003145057.png)

##### `ScreenShot`

Function Takes and saves the screenshot to `%APPDATA%\Screenshot\screen.jpeg` then sends it to the attacker. if the directory doesn't exist it will create it with the Hidden file attribute 

![image-20191220124050649](image-20191220124050649.png)

![image-20191220124124746](image-20191220124124746.png)

##### `webcam`

same as `screenshot` function, it saves the webcam capture to `%APPDATA% \\CamCampture\\webcam.jpeg` and send it.

![image-20191220124748419](image-20191220124748419.png)

![image-20191220125001495](image-20191220125001495.png)

These Functions are all controlled and managed by Boolean values to enable or disable features. If enabled, a timer will be set and run inside a thread and the function is called when an interval is elapsed.

![image-20191220130206301](image-20191220130206301.png)

File will also read an executable embedded inside it as a resource then drop it inside `%TEMP%` with the name format `{a-zA-Z}{3}\.exe`, it the will keep running in an infinite loop checking if the Daemon is still running and if not it will start it with the command line argument equals to the main malware full path.

![image-20191220131501152](image-20191220131501152.png)

![image-20191220130600799](image-20191220130600799.png)

the Daemon main function creates a thread and in the thread function, it checks to see if the file malware process is running to runs it again whenever it's killed. 

![image-20191220131922207](image-20191220131922207.png)

Which will result in a behavior where each module runs the other one

![b](b.gif)

Attackers also have implemented some anti-debugging and anti-VM techniques includes:

- Detect and kill any running process with the same name as any member of a given string array, Processes targeted are `anubis`, `a2servic`, `ashWebSv`, `hvk`, `avgemc`, `bdagent`, `avp`, `keyscrambler`, `mbam`, `ekrn`, `egui`, `npfmsg`, `ollydbg`, `outpost`, `wireshark`, `mcagent`, `mcuimgr`, `clamauto`, `cpf`, `ewido`, `FPAVServer`, `SbieSvc`, `antigen`, `ccapp`, `tmlisten`, `pccntmon`, `earthagent`, `spysweeper`
- Check if the current directory contains `sample` string
- Check if the current file name contains `sample` string
- Check for Processes/Services with one of the following names `DF5Serv`,  `VBoxservice`, `vmwareservice`,  `vpcmap`,  `vmsrvc`
- Check for a window's title set to `Wireshark`
