Minimal CTFd-like platform with basic flag validator ⚔️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿


### Why?
I created this repository as part of my learning process, I find things easier to understand when I'm doing it myself.
You're welcome to use this repository as study material or as another CTF platform. I'll keep making new challenges
when I find something interesting and put it here. Contributions are more than welcome BTW :D
